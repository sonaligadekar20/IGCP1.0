        <h2>Information</h2>

        <p><b>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern
                borders
                of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the
                Eurasian
                Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7<sup>th</sup>century BC, with selective stretches
                later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.
                Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The
                best-known
                sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty <u>(1368–1644)</u></b></p> <br />
