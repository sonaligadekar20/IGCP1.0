    <h2>Information</h2>

    <p>
           <b>Machu Picchu is a 15<sup>th</sup>-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a 
            2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.[2][3] Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the
            most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province[4]
            above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past
            it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.[5] In reference
            to the site’s name, for most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent. In English,
            the name is pronounced /ˌmɑːtʃuː ˈpiːtʃuː/[6][7] or /ˌmætʃuː ˈpiːktʃuː/,[7][8] in Spanish as [ˈmatʃu ˈpitʃu]
            or [ˈmatʃu ˈpiɣtʃu],[9] and in Quechua (Machu Pikchu)[10] as [ˈmatʃʊ ˈpɪktʃʊ].
